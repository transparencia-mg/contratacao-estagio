## Expected outcome:

- A git repository with dataset and script located in GitHub.
- A short (~2-3 minutes) video presentation of your git repository explaining what you have done and how it works. Please, use https://loom.com/ or similar software. We would like to assess your presentation skills so having your camera on would be a good advantage.

## Challenge

- Write a script to get a reproducible normalized CSV data file of Road Safety Facts and Figures in the EU.
- Include both script and your resulting data. 
- The documentation should be included in the README.md file and it must be clear to follow.
- The github repo should include anwsers to [this questions](https://github.com/transparencia-mg/contratacao-estagio/blob/main/questionario.md).

## More details:

- Use the following Wikipedia page and get the data from the “European Union Road Safety Facts and Figures” table: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_safety_in_Europe
- Resulting CSV file should only include the following columns: Country, Year, Area, Population, GDP per capita, Population density, Vehicle ownership, Total road deaths, Road deaths per Million Inhabitants. Note that “Year” column value is always 2018.
- Data should be sorted by “Road deaths per Million Inhabitants” column.
- We want a script for this and we want this script to be in python, so that you can demonstrate your knowledge of this given programming languages.
- Your git repo should include all dependencies in standard way so that it can be run in the CI/CD.
- Please, use simple and built-in libraries where possible rather than use a framework.

## Bonus items:

- Make your repository into a Tabular Data Package - here’s a [guide](https://datahub.io/docs/data-packages/publish-tabular).
- Build a chart from the data to display some interesting insight. Feel free to play around with the visualization.
- Make sure your chart is deployed to GitHub pages or somewhere else so we can take a look.
